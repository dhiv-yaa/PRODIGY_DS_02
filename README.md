# PRODIGY_DS_02
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, focusing on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project aims to explore the relationships between various features and identify patterns and trends within the data. The analysis includes:

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values through imputation or deletion.
Detecting and correcting data inconsistencies and errors.
Standardizing data formats for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performing descriptive statistics to summarize numerical variables.
Conducting univariate analysis using histograms, box plots, and bar charts.
Examining relationships between variables through bivariate analysis with scatter plots and correlation matrices.
Investigating multivariate interactions using pair plots and heatmaps.
Visualizations:

Creating histograms and box plots to visualize continuous variable distributions.
Using bar charts and pie charts for categorical data representations.
Developing scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to explore numerical variable relationships.
Generating pair plots for comprehensive multivariate analysis.
Pattern and Trend Identification:

Conducting survival analysis based on factors like age, gender, passenger class, and fare.
Grouping data to identify patterns, such as survival rates across different classes and gender.
Performing temporal analysis where applicable
